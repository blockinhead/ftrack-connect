Migrate to 2.0
==============

.. _release/migration/upcoming/developer_notes:

Users of a downloaded 
`Connect package <https://www.ftrack.com/portfolio/connect>`_ are
recommended to test the new version before upgrading all workstations.
Especially if you have custom locations implemented for the `legacy api`.


Developer notes
---------------
With version 2.0 connect drops support for ftrack-python-legacy-api.

hooks
.....

This means :

* Actions and events requires to update their registration from:


.. code-block::

    def register(registry, **kw):
        if registry is not ftrack.EVENT_HANDLERS:
            return


to:


.. code-block::

    def register(api_object, **kw):
        if registry is not isinstance(api_object, ftrack.Session):
            return


or will not be discovered anymore.

connector
.........

With this version we also drop the support for connector integration.

The codebase has been moved into a `separate repository <https://bitbucket.org/ftrack/ftrack-connector-legacy.git>`_
And will have to be included in the integration that requires connector to be present.


location
........

Since custom locations are not compatible between the different APIs all users
running from source with custom locations for the `legacy api` must either:

#.  Use the
    `Location compatibility layer <https://bitbucket.org/ftrack/ftrack-location-compatibility/>`_
    by putting it's resource folder on the `FTRACK_EVENT_PLUGIN_PATH`.
#.  Or, re-write the location using the `ftrack-python-api`.


Migrate from 0.1.19 to 0.1.20
===============================

.. _release/migration/0.1.20/developer_notes:

Developer notes
---------------

The :ref:`ftrack-python-api <ftrack-python-api:introduction>` will from now discover plugins that
are added to the `FTRACK_EVENT_PLUGIN_PATH`.

This means that register functions will be called several times, both for
the ftrack-python-api and the legacy api. To avoid registering a hook multiple
times, developers should validate the register functions arguments.


For event listeners like actions or event processing scripts we do::

    import ftrack

    ...

    def register(registry, **kw):
        '''Register plugin.'''

        # Validate that registry is the correct ftrack.Registry. If not,
        # assume that register is being called with another purpose or from a
        # new or incompatible API and return without doing anything.
        if registry is not ftrack.EVENT_HANDLERS:
            # Exit to avoid registering this plugin again.
            return

        # Register plugin event listener.
        ...

And for location plugins we verify that the registry is a
`ftrack.LOCATION_PLUGINS`::

    import ftrack

    ...

    def register(registry, **kw):
        '''Register plugin.'''

        # Validate that registry is the correct ftrack.Registry. If not,
        # assume that register is being called with another purpose or from a
        # new or incompatible API and return without doing anything.
        if registry is not ftrack.LOCATION_PLUGINS:
            # Exit to avoid registering this plugin again.
            return

        # Register location plugin.
        ...

Plugins for the new Python API must validate that they are called with an
`ftrack_api.session.Session` as a first argument::

    import ftrack_api

    ...

    def register(session, **kw):
        '''Register plugin.'''

        # Validate that session is an instance of ftrack_api.Session. If not,
        # assume that register is being called from an incompatible API
        # and return without doing anything.
        if not isinstance(session, ftrack_api.Session):
            # Exit to avoid registering this plugin again.
            return

        # Register plugin event listener.
        ...

Migrate from 0.1.2 to 0.1.3
===========================

Developer notes

.. _release/migration/0_1_3/developer_notes/updated_action_hooks:

Updated action hooks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default :ref:`discover <developing/hooks/action_discover>` and
:ref:`launch <developing/hooks/action_launch>` action hooks has been updated
to support the updated action format in ftrack 3.0.3. If you have created
custom hooks, please make sure they are updated accordingly. In the updated
format of the event data ``selection`` and the contents of ``actionData`` has
been moved to the root, ``event['data']``, level.
